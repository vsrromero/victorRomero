[Geonames API Task](./task)

●	Gazetteer - The specification was to reply to a website specification for a map-based app to provide information on countries, with a focus on a “mobile-first” development. Preferably using a framework, to then develop HTML, CSS and JavaScript with jQuery modules that use PHP server-based components to source data from third-party APIs (Geonames, OpenWeather). The solution is assessed on its delivery to specification, functionality, and usability.  
●	Company Directory - A more rigorous reply to this specification was required as a user requirements document was needed to be prepared which, when signed off, triggers the release of SQL allowing to develop a “mobile-first” application to maintain a company personnel database (MySQL). Sign off is only achieved upon the student supplying an independently witnessed document providing confirmation of the system’s ability to perform error-free.
